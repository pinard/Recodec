# processing of `-c' option depends on the fact that quotes to be changed
# in colons are exactly those which are in second position while the string
# is two characters in length.  This is sufficient for now.

# FIXME: Decoding is still quite rudimentary.  On this, `Free recode' is
# much more knowledgeable about French.
