A graph is made from a set of vertices, and a set of oriented arcs.

Each vertex should be immutable and not None.  An arc is a tuple.  The first
and second element of an arc are mandatory, and represent the starting
vertex and ending vertex for that arc.  The optional third element of an
arc is its associate positive cost, a cost of one is implied if none given.
