# FIXME: `-g' should either be re-implemented, or be replaced by a
# separate `ruler' encoding.

# FIXME: Allow ascii_graphics even with strict mapping.  Reported by
# David E. A. Wilson <david@osiris.cs.uow.edu.au>.

# Correspondance for IBM PC ruler graphics characters into ASCII graphics
# approximations.  The current principles are:
#
# - Single horizontal rulers are made up of dashes.
# - Double horizontal rulers are made up of equal signs.
# - Both single and double vertical are made up with `|'.
# - Both upper corners are rounded down with periods.
# - Lower corners are rounded up with grave/acute accent on left/right.
# - Other crossing rulers are approximated with plus signs, with exceptions
#   for double horizontal ruler crossings but not at corners: they are
#   equal signs inside a table, and `|' at left or right margin.
