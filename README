README for |package| |version|
==============================

.. include:: /home/pinard/GitHub/Recodec/doc/common.txt
.. |Recode| replace:: Free :code:`recode`

Here is |package| |version|, a clone of |Recode| meant for prototyping,
experimenting, and preparing what |Recode| version 4.X will
be.  You may find a manual for |package|, including installation
instructions, migration plans, and many other things as well, at
http://recodec.progiciels-bpi.ca/recodec.html .

I'm currently concentrating on TeX-related matters: that is, exploring
what are the differences between TeX, old LaTeX and LaTeX2e, and maybe
Bibtex, and increasing the ability to process more characters outside
Latin-1.  Despite implemented as charsets, TeX-related encodings are
neither real charsets nor surfaces deep down, but some kind of fallback
to be used in conjunction with other charsets.  Fallbacks need much
conceptual straightening and implementation research within |package|:
there is a lot of food for thought in this particular area.

This series of snapshots link the TeX (or LaTeX) charset to Unicode
instead of Latin-1.  Note that the ``t_names`` test still fails, this
failure does not need to be reported.  See the :file:`ChangeLog` in the
distribution for further details.
